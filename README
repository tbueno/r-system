Ruby implementation of L-System

This project is in a very initial stage, so don't create any great expectation yet! :-P


Right now, it's only possible to create 2D productions like the below:

l = LSystem.create do       
  rule "First" do
    alphabet ['F', '-', '-'] 
    axiom :F
    production ({:F => 'F-F+F+F-F'})
  end  
end

puts l.generate
puts l.generate
puts l.generate
